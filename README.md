## 👋 Hi, I'm Jonas Neves

I’m a Data Science student with hands-on experience in Data Engineering, Automation, and Operational Analytics applied to logistics environments.

My professional journey started on the road as a truck driver and later as a driver instructor. That operational background gave me a deep understanding of real-world logistics challenges. 
Today, I build data-driven systems to solve those challenges from a technical perspective.

Currently, I develop:

- Data ingestion and processing pipelines
- Relational modeling and structured storage in PostgreSQL
- Analytical dashboards (telemetry, cost analysis, operational performance)
- Workflow automation using n8n
- WhatsApp-based operational bots that act as data interfaces, allowing managers to query internal databases (e.g., vehicle plate lookup) and instantly receive structured decision-support information

My focus is on transforming raw data and manual processes into structured, automated, and decision-oriented systems.

I am actively consolidating my transition into Data Engineering, continuously improving my architecture design, scalability strategies, and analytics capabilities.
